# Simply Datetime

<br/>

### ***About***
Datetime is one of the most commonly used features in software development projects. Whether it's for logging events, scheduling tasks, or tracking user activity, the ability to work with date and time can be crucial. The standard C++ library offers the *\<chrono>* header to handle datetime, but it often becomes a pain considering the style of the standard library and its complex design. Simply Datetime aims to step in and provide a more intuitive and consistent API that makes it easier to perform datetime related operations. Less time and resources can be spent around abstracting and implementing datetime into projects, and more spent on whats important - the product.

### **Key Features**:
- **Efficient** - The library is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing its impact on your project's performance.
- **Portable** - Simply Datetime is built strictly with standard C++ and no dependancies. It is meant to work across different platforms and compilers, making it a reliable choice for cross-platform development.
- **Powerful** - This library is **NOT** to be mistaken for a simple datetime library. While the API is designed to be intuitive (and we take pride in our name), Simply Datetime offers all the features you would expect a datetime library to have. One of the most notable features of Simply Datetime is its ability to accurately simulate date and time.
- **Compatibility** - The primary objective of this library is to streamline and simplify the usage of the chronological header. However, it maintains a high degree of compatibility with the standard library. You can seamlessly convert between standard chronological time points and Simply Datetime Date/Datetime objects.
