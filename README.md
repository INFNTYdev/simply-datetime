# Simply Datetime
###### INFINITY Systems, LLC. 2024

<br/>

### ***About***
Datetime is one of the most commonly used features in software development projects. Whether it's for logging events, scheduling tasks, or tracking user activity, the ability to work with date and time can be powerful. The C++ standard library offers the *\<chrono>* header to handle datetime, but it may become a pain considering the style of the standard library and its complex design. Simply Datetime aims to step in and provide a more intuitive and consistent API that makes it easier to perform datetime related operations. Less time and resources can be spent on implementing datetime in projects, and more spent on whats important - the product.

<br/>

### **Key Features**
- **Efficient** - The library is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing its impact on your project's performance.
- **Portable** - Simply Datetime is strictly built from standard C++. It is meant to work across different platforms and compilers, making it a reliable choice for cross-platform development.
- **Powerful** - This library is **NOT** to be mistaken for a simple datetime library. While the API is designed to be intuitive (*and we take pride in our name*), Simply Datetime offers most features you would expect a datetime library to have.
- **Compatible** - The primary objective of this library is to streamline and simplify the usage of the chronological header while also maintaining a high degree of compatibility.

### **Updates**
> ## *Virtualized Datetime Family* (Emulation)
> [ August 18, 2024 ]

> The first addition to the Simply Datetime library is a family of virtualized datetime classes, which are designed to emulate real-world date and time with the use of simple arithmetic algebra. These objects provide powerful interfaces to perform detailed simulation and calculations while maintaining compatibility with the standard libraries *\<chrono>* header. Each type in this family can easily be driven manually without the need to worry about small details - virtual dates follow the real-world calendar and time objects conduct themselves accordingly. These types are not limited to simulation and can be used for a diverse set of applications.
