Datetime is one of the most common tools used in software development. Whether it's for logging events, scheduling tasks, or tracking user activity, the ability to harness date and time can be powerful. The standard C++ library offers the likes of the *\<chrono>* header to handle datetime, but it often becomes a pain considering the style of the standard library and its complex design. Simply Datetime aims to step in and provide a more intuitive and consistent API that makes it easier to perform datetime related operations. Less time and resources can be spent on the abstraction and implementation of datetime, and more spent on what's important - the product.
